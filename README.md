## Welcome to the Stock Portfolio Tracker app! ðŸ“ˆðŸ“Š

This unique application combines the best of both worlds: it serves as both a native iOS application and a Progressive Web App (PWA). The app shares a common backend, allowing seamless integration between platforms. Letâ€™s dive into the details:

### Concept
- Stock Portfolio Management: The app empowers users to create and manage their personalized stock portfolios. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned investor or just getting started, this app has you covered.
- Real-Time Stock Information: Stay up-to-date with the latest stock values. The app continuously fetches real-time stock data, allowing you to monitor your portfolioâ€™s performance effortlessly.
### Features
1. Native iOS App:
- Developed using Swift, the iOS app provides a smooth and intuitive experience for iPhone and iPad users.
- Access your stock portfolio on the go, receive notifications, and make informed decisions.
2. Progressive Web App (PWA):
- The PWA version runs in any modern web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
- Enjoy the same features as the iOS app, but from your desktop or mobile browser.
3. Shared Backend:
- Both the iOS app and PWA communicate with a common backend.
- The backend handles user data, stock information, and API requests.

## Project Overview

## Web
The web application was developed using next.js. It provides a user-friendly interface and allows interaction with the backend through APIs.

## iOS
The iOS app, built with Swift, delivers a seamless user experience on iPhones and iPads. It interfaces with backend services and offers essential features.

## Backend
